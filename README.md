q# QualityBoost: Reducing Production Errors
<img width="1138" height="629" alt="QualityBoost" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdf9c765-1d07-4d44-95e7-4d367c40efc0" />

## Objective
Increase confidence in the product and reduce failures in production by catching issues earlier in the development process.

## How It Works
- **Front-end Development**: Built a simple React application for demonstration.
- **Automated Testing**: Implemented unit and integration tests to validate functionality before deployment. Additionally, incorporated Prettier for consistent code formatting and ESLint to enforce coding standards and catch potential errors early.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Configured GitLab CI to:
  - Run all tests, including Prettier formatting checks and ESLint linting, on every commit.
  - Only allow deployment if all tests and linting checks pass.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated Grafana + Prometheus for real-time application monitoring and alerting.

## Benefits
- **Reliability**: Bugs and code style issues are detected before reaching production.
- **Rapid Feedback**: Developers receive immediate alerts on test failures, formatting issues, or linting errors, enabling proactive fixes.
- **Efficiency**: Automated processes, including formatting and linting, reduce manual intervention and human errors.

## Results
- Simulated reduction in production error rates by up to **80%**.
- Faster identification of critical issues, including code quality problems, before affecting customers.
- Improved confidence in releases through automated validation and consistent code standards.

## Technologies
- **Front-end**: React
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Prettier, ESLint
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Grafana, Prometheus
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose

## Key Learnings
- Importance of automated testing, including Prettier and ESLint, to prevent errors and maintain code quality before production.
- CI/CD ensures only validated and well-formatted code is deployed.
- Monitoring with Grafana + Prometheus provides proactive insights into potential issues.
- Combining automation, linting, and monitoring significantly increases software reliability.
