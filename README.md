# QualityBoost: Reducing Production Errors

## Objective
Increase confidence in the product and reduce failures in production by catching issues earlier in the development process.

## How It Works
- **Front-end Development**: Built a simple React application for demonstration.
- **Automated Testing**: Implemented unit and integration tests to validate functionality before deployment.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Configured GitLab CI to:
  - Run all tests on every commit.
  - Only allow deployment if all tests pass.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated Grafana + Prometheus for real-time application monitoring and alerting.

## Benefits
- **Reliability**: Bugs are detected before reaching production.
- **Rapid Feedback**: Developers receive alerts immediately and can fix issues proactively.
- **Efficiency**: Automated processes reduce manual intervention and human errors.

## Results
- Simulated reduction in production error rates by up to **80%**.
- Faster identification of critical issues before affecting customers.
- Improved confidence in releases through automated validation.

## Technologies
- **Front-end**: React
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI
- **Monitoring**: Grafana, Prometheus
- **Containerization**: Docker
